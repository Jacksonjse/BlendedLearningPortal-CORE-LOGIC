LOGIN logic - 7th October

1. the student data and the staff data is put into a constructor class and is checked from there.
2. the sign up page in triggered if the entered reg.no does not exist in the database
   {the initial idea was to keep a boolean flag, this idea can be worked upon GUI implementation}.
3. a boolean flag variable is kept so that if the login is successfull the flag is true and if it is unsuccesful it is false.
   This flag helps us to go to the next page.
